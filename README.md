# jQuery/Less/HTML/Gulp

## Getting Started

To get started, first install virtual host like:
XAMPP, Denver, MAMP, etc.

It will allow to use php script on form submit.

```
Start server. Go to http://localhost/. 
Fill all required fields of the form.
Submit. Get final page of succesful account creation.

```
```
If you want to see failed account creation page:
Go to /dev directory, run 'gulp compiler', it will init browser virtual host
But it won't be able to use php and will give an error on form submit.

```

To view your project, go to: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
